# bash scripts
## a collection of utility scripts

online collection of some bash scripts i've hacked together for personal use.
descriptions as follows:

1. make-floppy-img
-- written to create floppy images from [old online slackware directories](https://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-1.1.2/), so the rejects might be a bit odd in general. takes "-f (filename)" and "-u (url to download from)" and makes a raw .img from the downloaded data.
2. make-image-from-git
-- creates floppy images from a git http (ie. "./make-image-from-git -f screenfetch -u https://git.io/vaHfR)
