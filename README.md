# bash scripts
## a collection of utility scripts

online collection of some bash scripts i've hacked together for personal use.
descriptions as follows:

1. make-floppy-img
-- written to create floppy images from old online slackware directories, so the rejects might be a bit odd in general. takes "-f (filename)" and "-u (url to download from)" and makes a raw .img from the downloaded data.
